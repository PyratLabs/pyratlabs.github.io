    <div class="blocktext">
        <span title="/ ˈpaɪ rət læbz /">PyratLabs</span> is a brand of
        <span title="/ ˈpaɪ rət /">Pyrat</span> Ltd, founded by
        <a href="https://xanmanning.co.uk/">Xan Manning</a> in January
        2017. Pyrat Ltd was originally created when Xan faced redundancy
        in his role as a Systems DevOps Engineer and was investigating
        contracting roles. February 2017, Xan found full time permanent
        employment and Pyrat Ltd remained a domant company having never
        traded.
        <br /><br />
        A number of accounts had already been registered under the "Pyrat"
        name and became a brand for which Xan publishes code, for example
        "PyratLabs" on GitHub contains a number of free and open source
        projects published for consumption by the community. Projects will
        typically focus on Infrastructure as Code (IaC), automation and
        configuration management.
